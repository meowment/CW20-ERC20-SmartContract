# CW20-ERC20-Tutorial

This will take you through uploading your own CW-20/ERC-20 to the Source Chain testnet.
It uses the examples in the contracts/erc20 folder of the cosmwasm-examples repo.
There are four steps involved in working with a smart contract.

Write the smart contract (already done here!)

Store the smart contract on chain

Instantiate the smart contract (configure and initialise it)

Execute commands provided by the smart contract

We will go through all of these in this tutorial.
